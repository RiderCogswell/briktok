# TikTok for Shmucks

## Description
Professional TikTok clone built with Next.js, React, Sanity.io, TypeScript, and Tailwind! Login to like, post, or comment on videos!

UPDATE: Will be replacing Sanity backend with Flask - ([Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)), and Gin - ([Golang](https://go.dev/doc/)) respectively in their own repositories. (While Sanity is very easy, it's too slow for me ðŸ˜”)
